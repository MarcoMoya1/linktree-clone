# linktree-clone
This is a Linktree made from scratch.
The code consists of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses SVG icons from https://fontawesome.com/icons and is linked to my Twitter, Github, and LinkedIn accounts.
The page also consists of share buttons that will allow for sharing links
I got the idea for this repo from https://github.com/kubowania
